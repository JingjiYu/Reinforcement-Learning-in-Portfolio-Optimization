# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Portfolio-Optimization

This repository contains the full codes for my dissertation. Our work is implemented in jupyter notebooks, so it is suggested to refer to the '.ipynb' files.

The jupyter notebook 'Section 5.1-5.3 DQN and DGN.ipynb' may not be loaded quickly online. Thus, it is recommended to download the files instead of viewing online. 

In case the jupyter notebooks cannot be opened, please kindly download and open the html files, which are exactly the same as the notebooks. To download files: click the file -> right click "row" (or click download if it is available) -> download as ... -> change the suffix to .ipynb (or .html) -> open the file by the juypter notebook for ipynb files (or a web browser for html files).

As back-ups, the '.py' files are also available.
